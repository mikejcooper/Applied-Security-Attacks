Q.1 Imagine that instead of influencing data (i.e., the state matrix), a
    fault can influence control-flow (e.g., conditional statements, loop
    structure) somehow during execution.  Stating any assumptions you make,
    give an alternative attack strategy based on this ability.

Answer:
    Given the ability to influence control-flow, I would change the for loop
    where the round function is executed, such that the algorithm never enters
    the loop. This way we reduce AES encryption to one round, the last one, making
    it easier to recover the key.

Q.2 The question does not specify how faults are induced.  For the given
    attack target and context, explain one viable approach.

Answer:
    A fault can be introduced by a glitch in the power supply.

Q.4 How do the properties of different AES round functions influence the
    effectiveness of your attack?  More specifically, imagine SubBytes is
    removed: does this help or hinder your attack?

Answer:
    Removing the SubBytes operation removes the non-linearity of AES. This would
    help the attack.


Q.3 For side-channel attacks, the number of acquisitions required can be
    used as a measure of efficiency.  Outline the equivalent measure for
    fault attacks, and explain whether (and why) you think a side-channel
    attack on AES could be as efficient as a fault attack based on these
    measures.

Answer:
    In the case of fault attacks the equivalent measure is the number of faults
    required in order to recover they key. Introducing faults can be an expensive
    operation. The less faults required, the more efficient the attack is.
    Side channel attacks using this method are not efficient as they require a
    large number of samples.
