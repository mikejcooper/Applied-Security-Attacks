Q.1 Consider the parameters N = 3551, e = 5, d = 1373, and c = 888, all
    represented in decimal.  Use them to explain, in your own words, the
    principle of this attack (e.g., how and why it works).

    Aim:            The attacker wishes to determine the plaintext m ≡ c^d (mod N) corresponding to a given ciphertext c.

    Calculations:   Let B = 2^8(k-1), k = ceil(log_256(N)). Where k is the byte length of N.
                    In this attack k = 2 and B = 256.

    Assumption 1:   An attacker has access to an oracle that for any chosen ciphertext c' indicates whether the
                    corresponding plaintext y ≡ c'^d (mod N) is less than B or not — returning “y < B” (LT_B) or “y ≥ B” (GT_OR_EQ_B).
    Assumption 2:   An attacker knows the public key (N,e)
    Assumption 3:   2B < N. This assumption will usually be satisfied as RSA moduli are usually chosen to be exact multiples of 8 bits long.

    Overview:       The basic concept of this attack is to keep changing the ciphertext c in a specific way in order to reduce the range between which m exists.
                    The attacker chooses a multiple f_i and sends c_new = f_i^e · c (mod N) to the oracle.

                    Given the homomorphic properties of RSA, this ciphertext corresponds to the plaintext f_i · m, and provides a mathematical relationship between c and m.

                    The corresponding error codes from the oracle reveal information about the range.
                    The aim is to reduce this range with successive oracle queries until just one value is left, m.
                    As we know that know that m is a valid RSAES-OAEP plaintext, we know that the plaintext m is within a range 0 <= m < B.

    N = 3551, e = 5, d = 1373, and c = 888, B = 256

    Step 1:         The first step is to increment f1 by powers of 2 until * condition is met. Then return f1.
                    IF LT_B.        Range: [0,B)        0   <= f1 * m  < 256
                  * IF GT_OR_EQ_B.  Range: [B,2B)       256 <= f1 * m  < 512
                    ELSE error

                                                 (Iteration 0)          (Iteration 1)
        Example:    f1 = 2^i                        = 2               |     4
                    c_new = f1^e  *  c  mod  N      = 8               |     100
                    m = c_new^d mod N               = 246             |     492
                    error                           = 2 (LT_B)        |     1 (GT_OR_EQ_B) -> * END: Condition is met *

    Step 2:         The second step is to compute an f_2 = floor((n+B)/B) * f_1/2. This ensures, Range: N/2 < f2 * m < N + B
                    The attack then increments f2 = f2 + f1/2 until * condition is met.
                    IF GT_OR_EQ_B.  Range:  [n/2,n)     3551/2 <= f2 * m  < 3551
                  * IF LT_B.        Range:  [n,n+B)     3551   <= f2 * m  < 3807
                    ELSE error

                                                  (Iteration 0)           (Iteration 1)
         Example:   f_1                             = 4                 |  4
                    f_2 = floor((n+B)/B) * f_1/2    = 28                |  30
                    c_new = f2^e  *  c  mod  N      = 2331              |  2790
                    m = c_new^d mod N               = 3444              |  139
                    error                           = 1 (GT_OR_EQ_B)    |  2 (LT_B) -> * END: Condition is met *


    Step 3:         (3.1) This third step is to first calculate m_min = ceil(N  / f2)  and  m_max = floor((N + B) / f2)
                    (3.2) Then select a value f_tmp s.t. there are approximately 2B possible values for f_tmp * m.
                          By selecting f_tmp = floor(2*B / (m_max - m_min)).
                    (3.3) And a boundary point i = floor(f_tmp * m_min / N), to act as our mid-point in the range.
                    (3.4) Choose a multiple f_3 = ceil(i * N / m_min).
                          Range: i*N + B < f3 * m  < i*N + 2B
                    (3.5) The attacker can then adjust m_min = ceil((i * N + B) / f3)  or  m_max = floor((i * N + B) / f3) accordingly on
                          each iteration going back to step (3.2), until * condition is met.
                    This method effectively halves the search space with each iteration, until m_min = m_max = m.
                    IF GT_OR_EQ_B.    Range: [i*N,i*N+B)     i*N     <= f3 * m  < i*N + B
                    IF LT_B.          Range: [i*N+B,i*N+2B)  i*N + B <= f3 * m  < i*N + 2B
                  * IF m_min = m_max  Range: m_min  <= f3 * m  <= m_max

         Example:   f_2   = 56
                    m_max = floor((N + B) / f2)          = 126
                    m_min = ceil(N  / f2)                = 119

                                                        (Iteration 0)               (Iteration 1)     (Iteration 2)
                    f_tmp = floor(2*B / (m_max - m_min)) =  73                  |    170             |  512
                    i     = floor(f_tmp * m_min / N)     =  2                   |    5               |  17
                    f_3   = ceil(i * N / m_min)          =  60                  |    145             |  491
                    c_new = f3^e  *  c  mod  N           =  501                 |    1118            |  3281
                    m = c_new^d mod N                    =  278                 |    80              |  26
                    error                                =  1 (GT_OR_EQ_B)      |    2 (LT_B)        |  2 (LT_B)
                    m_max = floor((i * N + B) / f3)      =  126                 |    124 -> Update   |  123 -> Update    -> * END: Condition is met *
                    m_min = ceil((i * N + B) / f3)       =  123 -> Update       |    123             |  123              -> * END: Condition is met *

                    Solution: m = 123

                    Check: Does m^e mod N = c ?
                           Does 123^5 mod 3551 = 888 ?  YES!


Q.2 To prevent the attack, the vendor suggests altering the software: the
    idea is that no matter what error occurs, the same error code will be
    produced.  Explain whether (and why, or why not) this change alone is
    sufficient.

    This change alone is not sufficient to prevent the attack. The attacker can use side-channel attacks to distinguish the errors.
    For example, if the oracle returns an error as soon as it occurs, there will be a time difference.
    An attacker can use this difference to distinguish between errors and the same attack can be  performed, regardless of the error message actual contents.

Q.6 RSA has a homomorphic property: explain what this means, and how it
    relates to this attack.

    This means that mathematical operations to be performed on encrypted data without compromising the encryption.
    In this attack it means that the ciphertext c can be modified by a multiple f_i, and it holds that the corresponding plaintext will be f_i · m.

Q.8 Imagine you are a security consultant, employed by the device vendor.
    The vendor has heard that exponent and message blinding can be used to
    prevent some side-channel attacks on RSA. Explain whether these
    techniques would prevent this attack, and why.

    Blinding is a technique that allows for an agent to compute a function for a client without knowing either the real input or real output.
    It can be very useful on attacks such as timing attacks where the
    In in task we effective only send only information with the 'device' (oracle) one way. We send the ciphertext and receive an single plaintext error message.
    If we were to use blinding on the the ciphertext c and exponent e, the oracle could not sucessful decrpt the message at all, rendering the procedure useless.


Message blinding works by the multiplying the input message with a random value, and after exponentiation removing the effect of the random value.
Exponent blinding is a similar technique, but applied to the secret exponent.
In this task, blinding would not prevent this attack. As long as the label for the ciphertext remains valid i.e. the label had been produced using the
blind ciphertext, then the error messages from the oracle should remain the same.



* Blinding RSA with some random value /r/ leads to corresponding timings being uncorrelated to the operations being performed.
Precisely, before encryption the message is randomised in reversible manner therefore leading to simulation not corresponding to measures.
* Always performing reduction, whether it is needed or not can lead to non-informative time traces, therefore preventing timing attack.

There are a number of options to counter this attack. The first option against this attack specifically is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem;
because the attacker doesn't know p and q, they would no longer be able to simulate the model. However, there are already theoretical attacks against this countermeasure.

A similar method is to blind the message. This involves selecting a pair v_i and v_f such that v_i = v_f^-e (mod N). Before we begin decrypting our ciphertext c,
we create c' = c * v_i (mod N). After decryption, we get m' = c^d * v_i^d = m * (v_f^-e)^d = m * v_f^-1 (mod N). We can then multiply this by v_f and
get m' * v_f = m * v_f^-1 * v_f = m (mod N). If these values are kept secret, the attacker cannot learn anything useful about the input to the modular exponentiation.
It should be noted that v_i and v_f should be different for each encryption, otherwise there is a risk of extracting them based on timing analysis.
These can be easily computed however: Randomly compute an initial v_i and v_j at the start of the program's execution, and for each encryption produce
new values as v_i' = v_i^2 and v_j' = v_j^2.

The final method I looked at was to compute the reduction in every multiplication and return one of the two results depending on whether or not R >= N.
This method means that the Montgomery Multiplication now runs in constant time, but doesn't guarantee a lack of timing attacks in other areas.
