Q.1 Consider that instead of influencing data (e.g., the AES state), a
    fault might influence control-flow (e.g., a conditional statement)
    somehow during execution.  Stating any assumptions you make, give an
    alternative attack strategy based on this ability.
Q.2 Outline the methods available for hardening this AES implementation
    against fault attacks; for each method, explain any assumptions you
    make and compare it with the others wrt.  metrics such as robustness,
    latency, and memory footprint.
Q.4 For side-channel attacks, the number of acquisitions required can be
    used as a measure of efficiency.  Outline the equivalent measure for
    fault attacks, and explain whether (and why) you think a side-channel
    attack on AES could be as efficient as a fault attack based on these
    measures.
Q.5 How do the properties of different AES round functions influence the
    effectiveness of your attack?  More specifically, imagine SubBytes is
    removed: does this help or hinder your attack?
